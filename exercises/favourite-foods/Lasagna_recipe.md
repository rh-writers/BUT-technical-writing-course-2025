# Lasagna to die for

## Ingredients 
* Pasta – Homemade pasta is the best to use in this recipe.
* Bechamel – You will need to make bechamel sauce which is used in between the layers of this lasagna.
* Bolognese – I make a bolognese in this recipe using mirepoix, garlic, olive oil, pork, beef, and tomatoes.
* Cheese – I use a combination of whole milk mozzarella and parmesan cheese.

  ## Directions
  1. Make pasta layer 
  2. Then make bolognese layer
  3. Repeat until the deeptray is almost overflowing with pasta and bolognese sauce
  4. After this, add a bechamel layer and then add a generous amount of cheese on top
  5. Bake at 180C for 25minutes with a foil cover, then remove the cover and bake until the cheese is golden brown
  
Enjoy!
